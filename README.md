XChat-Colored-Nicks-Everywhere 0.70
===================================

Colors nicks in chat text with the same color X-Chat uses to display nicks.

Instructions for installing this plugin should be found on this page. http://xchat.org/faq/#q218

This is an updated version of the original made by Paul "Joey" Clark. This updated version is a bit more cpu efficient, with these main goals:

1. Create a collaborative location for contributors on github. https://github.com/Sepero/XChat-Colored-Nicks-Everywhere
2. Simplify the code where ever possible.
3. Introduce new features if applicable.

This update currently operates the same as the original. Contributed enhancements are welcome.
